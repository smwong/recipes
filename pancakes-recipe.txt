Pancake Ingredients:

    ¼ cup plain flour
    1 tsp baking powder
    1 tbsp caster sugar
    1 tbsp flavourless oil (I used sunflower)
    ¼ cup milk
    1 egg
    Pinch of salt

Optional extras:

    Maple syrup
    1 tbsp shredded coconut
    ¼ cup of blueberries
    Ice cream

Cheats Berry Sauce Ingredients:

    ¼ cup frozen berries
    1 tsp icing sugar

Instructions
Pancake Method:

    Sift dry ingredients into a jug and mix.
    In a separate bowl (I just use a mug), whisk together the egg, milk and oil until combined.
    Add the wet ingredients into the dry and stir until well combined. If using additional flavourings, such as berries or coconut, add now and stir gently to combine.
    Lightly grease a non-stick fry pan and heat to a medium temperature.
    Making this mixture in a jug will make it easier to portion out the batter – make this to your preferred size. I made 5 pancakes about 10cm in diameter.
    Cook until bubbles form on surface, flip and cook the other side until lightly browned.
    Serve either with a garnish of extra berries and coconut and a drizzle of maple syrup, or see below for a Cheats Berry Sauce.
